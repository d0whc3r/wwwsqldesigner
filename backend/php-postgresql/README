Postgresql server backend for wwwsqldesigner
version 0.1 beta

To use features below, please copy sample.database.ini to database.ini

Load/Save tables:
1. Add the database connection in the [loadlist] section of database.ini.
2. Import database.sql to that database.  It uses wwwsqldesigner table.
   If you changed the table in #2 then you need also to change database.sql
   table creation.

Importing database:
1. Add the database connection information in the [import] section of
   the credentials you want to use to import a database.
   Note: If you import and you don't specify a database, then it will use the
   database specified in the [import] section.

Diffing then saving tables back to database:
1. Add the database connection information in the [temp] section for a temporary
   blank database.  Tables in this database will be erased.  It will be used
   to create a diff of the current changes in the current database.
   Warning: For now diffing and saving only for saving in the [import] database.
2. Install apgdiff and make sure it's in the PATH.
